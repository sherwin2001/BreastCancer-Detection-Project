# BreastCancer-Detection-Project
This project uses machine learning to detect whether the person has Benign or Malignant breast cancer. 
I have trained four models which are:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree Classifier
 - Randome Forest Classifier
 - Support Vector Classifier
Out of these, the highest accuracy was obtained for Support Vector Classifier method (98.83 %).
